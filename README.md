**VoiceGIS** is a JavaScript library that adds powerful voice-control capabilities to web-based maps (Leaflet and OpenLayers). It uses a **hybrid architecture** with multiple deployment profiles—ranging from fast online cloud STT, to robust on-device AI (Whisper), down to constrained offline edge keyword spotting.

## 🚀 Why Hybrid? (Reality Check)

Browser-based speech recognition is a game of tradeoffs between bandwidth, accuracy, and latency. VoiceGIS embraces this reality:

1. **Web Speech API (Cloud)**: Convenient, instant, and highly accurate. However, it is often cloud‑backed and not fully under app control (audio may leave the device). Furthermore, it is only natively supported in some browsers (e.g., Chrome/Edge) and not fully supported in Firefox/Safari. It typically does not work offline.
2. **Browser-Only Whisper (On-Device)**: Provides excellent offline accuracy and privacy, but involves downloading a large model (on the order of a few-dozen MB for `tiny.en`, and 2-3x larger for `base.en`) and is compute-heavy. It is best used as an advanced or offline-fallback option.
3. **TF.js Command Mode (Edge KWS)**: Tiny, instantaneous keyword spotting engines are what real edge/embedded systems use for always-on commands. While limited to a fixed vocabulary, it operates flawlessly offline on constrained devices without massive downloads.

VoiceGIS's default `auto` strategy seamlessly routes between these engines depending on the user's connection and browser capabilities.

## 📦 Engine Profiles

| Profile | Engine Layer | Best For | Tradeoffs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Auto (Hybrid)** | `VoiceGIS` orchestrator | Consumer web apps | Switches dynamically between Cloud and Whisper based on network. |
| **Online Cloud** | `WebSpeechEngine` | Fast, low-latency UX | Requires internet; audio may be sent to third-party cloud. |
| **Offline Advanced** | `WhisperEngine` | Privacy, offline fields | Requires downloading 40MB+ model; high CPU usage. |
| **Offline Command** | `TfjsEngine` | Constrained devices | Only understands a small, fixed set of GIS commands. |
| **Private Server** | `WhisperServerEngine` | Enterprise / Secure Intranets | Requires hosting your own Whisper API backend. |

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install voicegis
```

*(Note: `leaflet` or `ol` are peer dependencies. Install the one you plan to use.)*

## ⏱️ Quickstart

### 1. Auto Mode (Recommended)

```javascript
import { VoiceGIS } from 'voicegis';

const app = new VoiceGIS({
  mapEngine: 'leaflet',
  mapContainerId: 'map',
  speechEngine: 'auto', // Intelligently routes between WebSpeech and Whisper
  autoExecute: true
});

await app.initSpeech();
app.start();
```

### 2. Private Server Mode

If you are hosting your own Whisper endpoint (e.g. `whisper.cpp` server):

```javascript
import { VoiceGIS } from 'voicegis';

const app = new VoiceGIS({
  speechEngine: 'server',
  autoExecute: true
});

// Configure the backend API URL
app.speech.apiUrl = 'http://localhost:8000/transcribe';

await app.initSpeech();
app.start();
```

### 3. Explicit Offline Command Mode

```javascript
import { VoiceGIS } from 'voicegis';

const app = new VoiceGIS({
  speechEngine: 'tfjs', // Forces the tiny edge keyword spotter
  autoExecute: true
});

await app.initSpeech();
app.start();
```

## 🔌 Public API Reference

The core of the library is the `VoiceGIS` orchestrator class. 

### `new VoiceGIS(options)`

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mapEngine` | `'leaflet'` \| `'openlayers'` | `'leaflet'` | The underlying map library you are using. |
| `mapContainerId` | `string` | `undefined` | DOM ID of the map container (if provided, map is auto-initialized). |
| `speechEngine` | `'auto'` \| `'webspeech'` \| `'whisper'` \| `'tfjs'` | `'auto'` | The STT engine strategy to use. |
| `autoExecute` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to automatically run parsed intents on the map controller. |
| `enableGeocoding`| `boolean` | `true` | Whether to use Nominatim for resolving unknown place names offline. |
| `onCommandParsed`| `function` | `undefined` | Callback `(result, rawText)` triggered when a voice command is understood. |
| `onStateChange` | `function` | `undefined` | Callback `(state)` where state is `'listening'`, `'idle'`, or `'error'`. |
| `onEngineSwitched`| `function` | `undefined` | Callback `(engineType)` triggered when the hybrid router switches engines. |

### Methods

- `initSpeech()`: Instantiates and warms up the selected speech engine. Returns a Promise.
- `start()`: Begins listening for voice commands.
- `stop()`: Stops listening.
- `registerCommand(intentName, pattern, action)`: Register custom application logic (see Recipes below).

## 🍳 Recipes: Custom Commands

While `voicegis` comes with built-in intents (zoom, pan, layers, markers), its real power lies in adding domain-specific commands for your application.

```javascript
import { VoiceGIS } from 'voicegis';

const app = new VoiceGIS({ mapContainerId: 'map' });

// 1. Register a custom regex command
app.registerCommand(
  'NAVIGATE_TO_ROOM', 
  /(?:take me to|navigate to) (conference room [a-c]|the cafeteria)/i, 
  (mapController, match) => {
    const destination = match[1];
    console.log(`Routing user to: ${destination}`);
    // Hook into your custom routing backend here (e.g. OSRM, AR.js)
  }
);

await app.initSpeech();
app.start();
```

## ⚡ Performance & Bundle Size

`VoiceGIS` implements a hybrid engine strategy. Because local on-device AI requires large weights, keep the following in mind:

- **WebSpeech Engine** adds virtually 0 bytes to your bundle, relying on the browser's native C++ implementation.
- **Whisper & TF.js** engines will dynamically load their weights (~40MB for Whisper `tiny.en`, ~5MB for TF.js) into the browser cache only when instantiated. 
- If you are building a strict web-app that will *never* go offline, you can configure your bundler (e.g. Vite/Webpack) to tree-shake `@huggingface/transformers` to aggressively reduce your vendor chunk size.

## 🧪 Evaluation Harness

We ship an offline evaluation harness to measure parser accuracy and prevent regressions.

```bash
# Run the benchmark suite against src/evaluation/benchmarks.json
npm run evaluate
```

## 📖 Architecture & Advanced Usage

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for a deep dive into the internal modules, state management, and deployment profiles.

## 🛠️ Limitations & Future Work

- **TF.js Engine**: The current `TfjsEngine` acts as a limited "Offline Command Mode" and is not a purpose-trained Keyword Spotting (KWS) model for VoiceGIS. A future iteration could train a custom small model specifically tuned to GIS commands.
- **Server Engine**: The `WhisperServerEngine` acts as an HTTP client stub. The actual Python/Go backend server implementation is out of scope for the core library.
